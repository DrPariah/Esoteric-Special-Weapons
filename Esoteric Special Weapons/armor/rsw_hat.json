    "description": "A pot-like helmet dating back to the dark days of the first world war, the Brodie helmet (actually known as the Helmet, Steel, Mark I) was one of the first steel helmets to see use in modern warfare. It is derived from a relatively simple construction process, high hardness steel being stamped into a vague pot-like shape. Generally considered to be lacking in coverage compared to later helmets in America, Europe and Russia.",
