Although it looks like a sword, it was principally used as a machete that was more fit for cutting brush than people, and as such is a fairly poor combat weapon. As a side arm, it was used by soldiers in artillery regiments in both sides of the civil war.",

Designed in part to give Japanese infantrymen the reach to attack cavalrymen, the blade is among the longest ever made for any mass-produced bayonet at over fifteen inches in length.",
