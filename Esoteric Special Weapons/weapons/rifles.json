Unlike its more conventional assualt rifle brethren, the APS fires a flechette-like spear out of a smoothbore barrel and relies on hydronamic effects in order to maintain accuracy. It is nearly useless on land.",

Such a peculiar energy source for the time came at a price, though: the weapon was fairly unreliable despite the advantages it brought to the table that made it in many ways a peerless weapon. Has a VERY long reload time to account for charging the weapon's compressed air bottle.",

In some way's the rifle's technological advancement was its own undoing: the gun's peculiar caseless round proving to be less capable of dissipating heat then conventional brass ammunition, in addition to being harder to care for in the field. Rivtech eventually realized that there was the potential for a small but dedicated consumer market around the G11, and elected to make faithful reproductions with the notable exception of using proprietaty 8mm casless ammunition as opposed to the G11's 4.7mm caseless ammunition.",

    "description": "Derived from the need for a small arm capable of providing wide fields of covering fire during the Russo Japanese War and WW1, the Type 11 is an air-cooled light machine gun chambered for the 6.5mm Arisaka cartridge. Unique to the type 11 is its rather quixotic method of ammo storage, featuring a hopper storing six stripper clips worth of 6.5mm ammunition, with each clip being deposited as it was stripped of its cartridges. The Type 11 poorly utilizeed standard 6.5mm rounds, and as such the anemic 6.5mm 'genso' cartridge was designed for use with the machine gun. Unfortunately CDDA can't accomdate multiple clips in one weapon so this firearm can't really use multiple clips at once, or any at all really.",

Despite their complexity they saw combat with the U.S. Army during the Seminole war. As this is a modern reproduction, it avoids some of the problems with the chain-firing seen on initial production runs of cap and ball revolving rifles.",

Unlike the vast majority of firearms, the gyrojet family of weapons uses a small rocket propelled-projectile, with the lethality of its projectile being at maximum some distance after the muzzle. Due to the rocket-propelled projectile at the heart of the gyrojet system, gyrojet weapons could be made to be very lightweight on account of having little recoil, and very quiet as well. Despite their advanced features, the gyrojets were marred by development problems, anemic damage output at close range and general inaccuracy. This is a very rare variant of gyrojet rifle, equipped with a ballistic computer, scope and wire-guided guidance system for gyrojet smart rounds.",
