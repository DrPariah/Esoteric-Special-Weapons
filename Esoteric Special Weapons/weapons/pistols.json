    "description": "Famous for being one of the smallest firearms ever made, the Kolibri pistol is a semi-automatic micro handgun designed in the Austro-Hungarian Empire on the eve of the first world war. It is perhaps fitting that its designer, Franz Pfannl, was a watchmaker, as a weapon of this liliputian scale could only be made with the precision and craft of such a precise artisan. Despite, or perhaps because of, the gun's odd nature and extremely anemic cartridge, it did not sell well at all and has since become a collector's item. Whether or not this weapon will have any use in the cataclysm is very much in doubt.",

Unlike most revolvers, the TOZ-81's barrel is situated beneath the bottom cylinder rather than the top. Although unique, the TOZ-81 failed to receive approval from the Soviet Government.",
